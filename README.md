> **ðŸ§  About This Fork**
>
> This repository is a **fork** of the original [Qwen2.5-VL](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL) project by the QwenLM team.
> We are adapting the codebase for our **AI4XR** research, focusing on deploying **multimodal models** in **Extended Reality (XR)** environments.
> Our goals include lightweight inference, XR-specific fine-tuning, and the use of LLMs/VLMs for interaction/understanding/visualization in XR.
> Please refer to the original repository for upstream updates and citations.
